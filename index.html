  <h2> Apparatuses </h2> <!--Different heading sizes-->
  <p> Hello! Perhaps you have seen of or heard of rhythmic gymnastics before. More well known by the general public is artistic gymnastics (think: beams, bars, tumbles, Simone Biles, etc.). However, what many people remember about rhythmic gymnastics is its unique apparatuses. Most people seem to recognize the ribbon (some incorrectly referring to rhythmic gymnastics as ribbon dancing) and hoop. There are more apparatuses, in particular: </p>

		  <li> (and Floor, although as the name suggests, no apparatuses are involved) </li>

  <p> Each competition season in the US, every level is assigned 3-4 apparatuses by a national association. Lower levels have only 3 apparatuses per year, while higher levels have more. Additionally, in the higher levels, floor no longer remains an option. And generally, rope, ball, and hoop are considered more fit for beginners, and usually, a gymnast will compete in all 3 of these apparatuses + floor in the first few years of competition. Ribbon and clubs are typically assigned in later years. For example, I only encountered clubs for the first time in level 7 after experiencing all the other apparatuses. </p>
  <p> In my personal experience and opinion, I love all of the apparatuses and think that each one has its unique characteristics. For example, in ribbon, it is extremely important to keep the ribbon moving and off the ground at all times. And all points earned while there is a knot in the ribbon are not counted, which is particular challenge to avoid, especially in drafty competition venues. Clubs are also particularly unique because there are two of them, so there are several ways to connect them together! </p>
  <p> All of the apparatuses are tailored to the size of the gymnast. Rope and hoop change according to the gymnast's height, and the length of ribbon, length of clubs, and diameter of ball are also modified. Moreover, the colors and style of these apparatuses are taped and styled to match a gymnast's leotard, which is always extremely beautiful to me. </p>
  <p> A gymnast is responsible for one routine per apparatus. In group gymnastics, multiple apparatuses may be incorporated in one routine! Feel free to read more about routines and competitions in the next section! </p>
  <h2> Routine/Competition Format </h2> 
  <p> Routines are one minute 30 seconds for individual gymnasts and two minutes 30 seconds for group routines. Beeps are included in the music to signify particular points in time. </p>
  <p> Moreover, the carpet includes a tape demarking the bounds. If a gymnast or her apparatus goes "out of bounds," points are deducted, and at higher level competitions, backup apparatuses are placed on each side of the carpet for gymnasts to take and use if an apparatus goes too far out of bounds to chase or an apparatus breaks. </p>
  <p> A panel of judges scores each gymnast on execution and difficulty, with each mastery and risk corresponding to a point value and points being deducted for non-pointed toes or bent knees at the wrong times. Furthermore, each level may have point limits or requirements to be included in the routines.</p> 
  <p> Competitions usually include a portion when all the gymnasts walk with their team around the carpet before the competition and are introduced team by team. During the competition, non-competing gymnasts practice in a designated area, and the roster of gymnasts is rotated through several times so that no individual gymnast is every performing routines back to back. There is only one performance for each routine/apparatus, unless technical difficulties or unusual circumstances arise. At higher levels, competitions are frequently spread over multiple days, with one or two apparatuses being performed each day. </p>
  <p> Here is a video compilation of <a href = "https://youtu.be/dxUAPl95CbY"> real mistakes at the 2018 World Championships </a>, including examples of gymnasts who used the provided backup apparatuses and went out of bounds. </p>
